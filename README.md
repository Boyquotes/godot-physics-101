# Godot Physics 101

## TLDR

Compilation of physical scenes and simulations for inspection and learning of GodotEngine physics.

## Explanation

Since I started working with game engines, I have been interested in the implemented physical systems. Since I wanted to do 2D simulations, there were only few possibilities at that time (e.g. Box2D). Then I stumbled across the Godot Engine and was immediately convinced of its power. So I did a lot of testing in a lot of simple projects to get a grasp of the underlying mechanics. Now I would like to summarize my knowledge in one project/repository and make it understandable for others. So here we are: Godot Physics 101.

## How it works

When running the project you'll get a welcome screen where you can choose one of the provided scenes. These encapsulate one aspect of Godots capabilities in simulating a physical world. You can start a scene, watch it running (or interacting with it) and read about its foundations in a description sidebar. There are scenes for 2D and 3D physics.
